SciML provides a large number of explicit and implicit solvers suited for different types of ODE problems. It is possible to reduce a system of partial differential equations into an ODE problem by employing the method of lines (MOL). The essence of MOL is to discretize the spatial derivatives (by finite difference, finite volume or finite element methods) into algebraic equations and to keep the time derivatives as is. The resulting differential equations are left with only one independent variable (time) and can be solved with an ODE solver. Solving Systems of Stochastic PDEs and using GPUs in Julia is a brief introduction to MOL and using GPUs to accelerate PDE solving in JuliaDiffEq.

That is the potassium current, which activates at large voltages and makes the voltage more negative. The three functions n_inf; m_inf; h_inf help us to find good initial values for the gating variables. Those functions tell us that the steady-state gating values should be for the initial voltage. The parameters were chosen in a way that the properties of the model roughly resemble that of a cortical pyramidal cell instead of the giant axon Hodgkin and Huxley were originally working on.","category":"page"},{"location":"models/04-spiking_neural_systems/","page":"Spiking Neural Systems","title":"Spiking Neural Systems","text":"sol = solve(prob);\nplot(sol, vars=1)","category":"page"},{"location":"models/04-spiking_neural_systems/","page":"Spiking Neural Systems","title":"Spiking Neural Systems","text":"(Image: )","category":"page"},{"location":"models/04-spiking_neural_systems/","page":"Spiking Neural Systems","title":"Spiking Neural Systems","text":"That's some good regular voltage spiking.

One of the most important features of real synapses is that their maximum conductance is not the same on every event. The number and frequency of synaptic events changes the size of the maximum conductance in a dynamic way. While we usually avoid anatomical and biophysical details of real synapses, there is a widely used phenomenological way to capture those dynamics called the Tsodyks-Markram synapse.","category":"page"},{"location":"models/04-spiking_neural_systems/#Tsodyks-Markram-Synapse","page":"Spiking Neural Systems","title":"Tsodyks-Markram Synapse","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"models/04-spiking_neural_systems/","page":"Spiking Neural Systems","title":"Spiking Neural Systems","text":"The Tsodyks-Markram synapse (TMS) is a dynamic system that models the changes of maximum conductance that occur between EPSPs at different frequencies. The single response is similar to the alpha synapse in that it rises instantaneously and decays exponentially. The maximum conductance it reaches depends on the event history. To simulate the TMS we need to incorporate three more dimensions, u, R, gsyn into our system. u decays towards 0, R decays towards 1 and gsyn decays towards 0 as it did with the alpha synapse. The crucial part of the TMS is in epsp!, where we handle the discontinuities when a synaptic event occurs. Instead of just setting gsyn to the maximum conductance gmax, we increment gsyn by a fraction of gmax that depends on the other two dynamic parameters. The frequency dependence comes from the size of the time constants tau_u and tau_R.

Assuming a constant acceleration of gravity, g, every burgeoning physicist knows the answer: x(t) = x(0) + vt - frac12gt^2. However, what happens if g is not constant? Specifically, g is inversely proportional to the distant from the center of the planet. If v is large and the projectile travels a large fraction of the radius of the planet, the assumption of constant gravity does not hold anymore. However, unless v is large compared to the escape velocity, the correction is usually small.
